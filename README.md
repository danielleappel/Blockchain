# Blockchain

My research project focuses on blockchain â€“ a peer to peer electronic cash system that eliminates single points of failure. Blockchain technology can be used in any situation where transactions are necessary and utilizes cryptography as well as a decentralized, distributed ledger to verify transactions. The other focus of my research is on creating a working Python implementation that can support the basic functions of a blockchain, including a block mining procedure and integration with a Rest API so that the blockchain can be accessed from the command line. Finally, a reflection on the current state of Bitcoin: the ever climbing price, eventual end of mining, and the lack of anonymity.
